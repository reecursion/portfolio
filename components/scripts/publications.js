            abstract: "Inspiration is linked to various positive outcomes, such as increased creativity, productivity, and happiness. Although inspiration has great potential, there has been limited effort toward identifying content that is inspiring, as opposed to just engaging or positive. Additionally, most research has concentrated on Western data, with little attention paid to other cultures. This work is the first to study cross-cultural inspiration through machine learning methods. We aim to identify and analyze real and AI-generated cross-cultural inspiring posts. To this end, we compile and make publicly available the InspAIred dataset, which consists of 2,000 real inspiring posts, 2,000 real non-inspiring posts, and 2,000 generated inspiring posts evenly distributed across India and the UK. The real posts are sourced from Reddit, while the generated posts are created using the GPT-4 model. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive computational linguistic analyses to (1) compare inspiring content across cultures, (2) compare AI-generated inspiring posts to real inspiring posts, and (3) determine if detection models can accurately distinguish between inspiring content across cultures and data sources.",

            abstract: "In recent years, a significant portion of the content on various platforms on the internet has been found to be offensive or abusive. Abusive comment detection can go a long way in preventing internet users from facing the adverse effects of coming in contact with abusive language. This problem is particularly challenging when the comments are found in low-resource languages like Tamil or Tamil-English code-mixed text. So far, there has not been any substantial work on abusive comment detection using imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, significant work has not been performed, especially for Tamil code-mixed data, that involves analysing the dataset for classification and accordingly creating a custom vocabulary for preprocessing. This paper proposes a novel approach to classify abusive comments from an imbalanced dataset using a customised training vocabulary and a combination of statistical feature selection with language-agnostic feature selection while making use of explainable AI for feature refinement. Our model achieved an accuracy of 74% and a macro F1-score of 0.46.",

                abstract: "Abusive language has lately been prevalent in comments on various social media platforms. The increasing hostility observed on the internet calls for the creation of a system that can identify and flag such acerbic content, to prevent conflict and mental distress. This task becomes more challenging when low-resource languages like Tamil, as well as the often-observed Tamil-English code-mixed text, are involved. The approach used in this paper for the classification model includes different methods of feature extraction and the use of traditional classifiers. We propose a novel method of combining language-agnostic sentence embeddings with the TF-IDF vector representation that uses a curated corpus of words as vocabulary, to create a custom embedding, which is then passed to an SVM classifier. Our experimentation yielded an accuracy of 52% and a macro F1-score of 0.54.",

However, on social media platforms, where people have the license to be anonymous, toxic comments targeted at homosexuals, transgenders and the LGBTQ+ community are not uncommon. Detection of homophobic comments on social media can be useful in making the internet a safer place for everyone. For this task, we used a combination of word embeddings and SVM Classifiers as well as some BERT-based transformers. We achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.93 on the English dataset, 0.75 on the Tamil dataset and 0.87 on the Tamil-English Code-Mixed dataset.",
